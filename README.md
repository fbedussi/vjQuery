# vjQuery
A lightweight wrapper on native DOM API to enable the beauty and elegance of the jQuery API.

## What it is
A simple and lightwight (2k gzipped) (almost) drop in replacement for some of the more used jQuery methods written in modern vanilla JavaScript using native DOM API:

## API
- addClass
- removeClass
- toggleClass
- each
- map
- filter
- on
- off
- one
- click
- trigger
- eq
- find
- first
- last
- focus
- get
- next
- nextAll
- prev
- prevAll
- siblings
- toArray

All AJAX and promise related methods are intentionally left out in favour of the fetch API, and the native promises.
